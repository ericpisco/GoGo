Title of the Project: Go

Description of the Project:
Go is an innovative online platform that furnishes comprehensive information for your planned journeys. Leveraging the Distance Matrix API, Places API, Maps JavaScript API, and Directions API, our platform taps into the capabilities of Google API, Places API, and Directions API to provide accurate and reliable travel data. Additionally, we offer a To-Do list feature designed to assist you in planning your daily activities seamlessly.

The cost calculation feature is structured based on the pricing model introduced by Yego Cabs. Users are charged 400 RWF for the first 2 kilometers of their journey, with an additional 400 RWF charge for each subsequent kilometer. This transparent pricing model ensures clarity, enabling you to effectively plan your travel expenses.

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS-Express, and a MySQL database, our commitment lies in delivering a seamless and user-friendly experience. We aim to empower you to make informed decisions about your journeys.
